# tictactoe-in-pygame
this is an implementation of the tic-tac-toe game in pygame with customisable rows, columns and mark count to win

[tic-tac-toe ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe "tic-tac-toe ") is a classic two-player strategy game played on a standard 3Ã—3 grid (or larger grids in special cases). The goal is to get three of your marks (either X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal before your opponent does.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play
